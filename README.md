# Earth and Fridge
Hello! This is a project I did in the fall quarter of 2020. The goal was to use object oriented programming to show off a massive goal, then scale it down to produce a demo within our capabilities. I envisioned a smart fridge that could see the different food choices made, and tell you how sustainable each one of your choices were.

### Improving the project:
Quite honestly, now that I've come back to look at my old projects, I think this project deserves a little bit more love than its rushed finals week implementation actually gave it. So here'a To-Do list for possible upgrades that could make it a lot more usable:
- [x] Remove "undefined" items and display an accompanying error message
- [] Add a fuzzy search
- [] Autocomplete suggestions bar
- [] Proper support for the "enter" keypress
- [] A much more striking design (This project isn't in my design portfolio for a reason).
